# Counter App
This is a simple Counter App yet engaging project aimed at implementing a basic counter feature using the React library.
The user interface consists of two buttons: + button to increment the counter and - button to decrease the counter and a display area to showcase the current count. The primary functions of the buttons are to increment and decrement the count, with the updated count being displayed in real-time.
